You are given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "node", t = "neetcode"

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

Output: false
Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 10,000
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
